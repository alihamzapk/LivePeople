    <h2 class="coming-soon">What are the meanings of the Categories in the catalog ?</h2>
    <h6 class="coming-soon">"Dataset" refers to a single dataset (e.g 2018-SU2-Trento-Accelerometer Event), recognised by year (2018), acronym for the data collection experiment (SU2 for SmartUnitn2), site (Trento), and the name of the sensor or contribution dataset (accelerometer event). Dataset bundle is a grouping of similar datasets, for example, 2018-SU2-Trento-Connectivity contains the sensors classified under the connectivity, such as bluetooth and wifi. A project is a data collection experiment carried out in a given location, such as 2018-Smart Unitn 2-Trento, Experiment contains all the projects in the same data collection, such as Wenet Diversity 1.</h6>
