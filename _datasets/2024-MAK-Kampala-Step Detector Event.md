title: 2024-Makerere-Kampala-Step Detector
organization: Unitn
notes: This dataset exploits the Android API that counts (incrementally) the number
  of steps since the devices booted. The step detector sensor collects an event each
  time a step is taken by the user. The value reported by the sensor is always one,
  the fractional part being always zero, and the event timestamp is the time when
  the user's foot hit the ground.  It is part of the Makerere data collection, which
  contains data about the everyday life activities of students coming from Makerere
  University located in Uganda. The data were collected via questionnaires, data coming
  from 30 smartphone sensors associated to thousand self-reported annotations over
  a period of 8 weeks.
