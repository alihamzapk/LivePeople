title: 2022-OC2-Thessaloniki-Step Detector
organization: Unitn
notes: This dataset is from a sensor that returns a label identifying the activity
  performed by the user, accurately detected using low power signals from multiple
  sensors in the device. This is achieved using Google’s Activity Recognition API.
  Possible activities are; still, in_vehicle, on_bycicle, on_foot, running, tilting,
  walking. The dataset was collected as part of the WeNet project, a Horizon 2020
  funded project that aims at developing a diversity-aware, machine-mediated paradigm
  for social interactions. It collected information on the eating/drinking activities
  of the students of the UTH University.
