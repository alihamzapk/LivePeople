title: 2022-OC2-Thessaloniki-Step Detector
organization: Unitn
notes: This dataset is from a sensor that returns a label identifying the activity
  performed by the user, accurately detected using low power signals from multiple
  sensors in the device. This is achieved using Googleâ€™s Activity Recognition API.
  Possible activities are; still, in_vehicle, on_bycicle, on_foot, running, tilting,
  walking. The dataset was collected as part of the WeNet project, a Horizon 2020
  funded project that aims at developing a diversity-aware, machine-mediated paradigm
  for social interactions. It collected information on the eating/drinking activities
  of the students of the UTH University.
