title: 2020-DiversityOne-Copenhagen-Step Detector
organization: Unitn
notes: This dataset exploits the Android API that counts (incrementally) the number
  of steps since the devices booted. The step detector sensor collects an event each
  time a step is taken by the user. The value reported by the sensor is always one,
  the fractional part being always zero, and the event timestamp is the time when
  the userâ€™s foot hit the ground. It is part of Wenet Diversity 1 data collection,
  which contains data about the everyday life activities of students coming from 8
  different universities located in China, Denmark, India, Italy, Mexico, Mongolia,
  Paraguay and UK. The data were collected via questionnaires, data coming from 27
  smartphone sensors associated to thousand self-reported annotations over a period
  of 4 weeks.
