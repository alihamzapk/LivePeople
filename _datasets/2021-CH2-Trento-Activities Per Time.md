title: 2021-ChatApplicationTwo-Trento-Activities
organization: Unitn
notes: The dataset returns a label identifying the activity performed by the user,
  accurately detected using low power signals from multiple sensors in the device.
  This is achieved using Googleâ€™s Activity Recognition API. Possible activities are;
  still, in_vehicle, on_bycicle, on_foot, running, tilting, walking. The dataset was
  collected as part of the WeNet project, a Horizon 2020 funded project that aims
  at developing a diversity-aware, machine-mediated paradigm for social interactions.
