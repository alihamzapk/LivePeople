title: 2024-Makerere-Kampala-Geomagnetic Rotation Vector
organization: Unitn
notes: The geomagnetic rotation vector sensor consists of an accelerometer + magnetometer
  which helps in conserving battery while using apps like Gmaps, Compass, etc. That
  sensor helps in finding where the phone is pointed at, with respect to the  magnetic
  poles and the phones orientation (landscape or portrait).  It is part of the Makerere
  data collection, which contains data about the everyday life activities of students
  coming from Makerere University located in Uganda. The data were collected via questionnaires,
  data coming from 30 smartphone sensors associated to thousand self-reported annotations
  over a period of 8 weeks.
