title: 2024-Makerere-Kampala-Gyroscope Uncalibrated
organization: Unitn
notes: This dataset contains gyroscope information that is not calibrated. All values
  are in radians/second and measure the rate of rotation around the X, Y and Z axis.
  An estimation of the drift on each axis is reported as well. No gyro-drift compensation
  is performed. Factory calibration and temperature compensation is still applied
  to the rate of rotation (angular speeds).  It is part of the Makerere data collection,
  which contains data about the everyday life activities of students coming from Makerere
  University located in Uganda. The data were collected via questionnaires, data coming
  from 30 smartphone sensors associated to thousand self-reported annotations over
  a period of 8 weeks.
