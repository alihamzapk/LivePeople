title: 2021-Chat Application 1-Copenhagen
organization: Unitn
notes: The Wenet Chat Application 1 project was based on a chatbot that collected
  questions and answers from university students in Italy, Denmark, Paraguay, the
  United Kingdom, and Mongolia. It was conducted in March and June 2021 to improve
  the knowledge about students' lives to promote the design of better and more targeted
  technology and support tools for students. It was a European Union WeNet Horizon
  2020-funded project with the overall goal of developing a diversity-aware, machine-mediated
  paradigm for social interactions. Data was collected with a Telegram App and the
  i-Log Application. Some of the data collected included the respondent’s career information
  (department, study course, study year,) and demographics (age, gender…). Questions
  were sent on the Telegram App and user answers were recorded, the i-Log App recorded
  sensor data (such as location, accelerometer…) from the user device. This data was
  collected in three phases, the first phase entailed interacting with the Telegram
  App Ask4Help, and sensor data was also collected during this phase. The second phase
  involved respondents answering a questionnaire, and in the third phase, they participated
  in a focus group to provide feedback.
