title: 2020-DiversityOne-Copenhagen-Device-usage
organization: Unitn
notes: The study aimed to assess diversity through the social practices and daily
  behaviors of university students from eight different countries. The research was
  carried out in two phases. Initially, a large sample of students from Denmark, Italy,
  Mongolia, Paraguay, the United Kingdom, China, Mexico, and India, completed a survey
  on their social practices, as well as their socio-demographic, cultural, and psychological
  elements. In the second phase, a sub-sample of the respondents engaged in a four-week
  data collection by using an innovative smartphone application called iLog. This
  app collected data from thirty-four smartphone sensors around the clock, allowing
  for an in-depth investigation into the diversity and daily routines of university
  students across countries, both synchronically and diachronically.
