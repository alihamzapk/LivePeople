organization: Unitn
notes: The Wenet Chat Application 2 project was based on a chatbot that interacted with university students in Italy, Denmark, Paraguay, the United Kingdom, and Mongolia. It was conducted from December 2021 till early 2022 to verify the diversity among students based on social practices. This project builds on the Wenet Chat Application Pilot I project. It was a European Union WeNet Horizon 2020-funded project with the overall goal of developing a diversity-aware, machine-mediated paradigm for social interactions. Data was collected with a Telegram Chatbot called Ask4help and the i-Log Application. Some of the data collected included the respondent's career information (department, study course, study year,) and demographics (age, gender). Questions were sent on the Telegram App and user answers were recorded, the i-Log App recorded sensor data (such as location, accelerometer) from the user device. This data was collected in three phases, the first phase entailed interacting with the Telegram Chatbot, and sensor data was also collected during this phase. The second phase involved respondents answering a questionnaire, and in the third phase, they participated in a focus group to provide feedback.
