title: 2024-Makerere-Kampala-Accelerometer Uncalibrated
organization: Unitn
notes: This dataset gathers information from the accelerometer sensor, returning uncalibrated
  values. Uncalibrated sensors provide more raw results and may include some bias
  but also contain fewer "jumps" from corrections applied through calibration. Some
  apps may prefer these uncalibrated results as smoother and more reliable.  It is
  part of the Makerere data collection, which contains data about the everyday life
  activities of students coming from Makerere University located in Uganda. The data
  were collected via questionnaires, data coming from 30 smartphone sensors associated
  to thousand self-reported annotations over a period of 8 weeks.
