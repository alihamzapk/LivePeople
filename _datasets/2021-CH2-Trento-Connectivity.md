organization: Unitn
notes: The Wenet Chat Application 2 project was based on a chatbot that interacted
  with university students in Italy, Denmark, Paraguay, the United Kingdom, and Mongolia.
  It was conducted from December 2021 till early 2022 to verify the diversity among
  students based on social practices. This project builds on the Wenet Chat Application
  Pilot I project. It was a European Union WeNet Horizon 2020-funded project with
  the overall goal of developing a diversity-aware, machine-mediated paradigm for
  social interactions. Data was collected with a Telegram Chatbot called Ask4help
  and the i-Log Application. Some of the data collected included the respondent's
  career information (department, study course, study year,) and demographics (age,
  gender). Questions were sent on the Telegram App and user answers were recorded,
  the i-Log App recorded sensor data (such as location, accelerometer) from the user
  device. This data was collected in three phases, the first phase entailed interacting
  with the Telegram Chatbot, and sensor data was also collected during this phase.
  The second phase involved respondents answering a questionnaire, and in the third
  phase, they participated in a focus group to provide feedback.
