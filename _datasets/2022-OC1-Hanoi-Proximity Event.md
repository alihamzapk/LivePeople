notes: This dataset measures the distance between the user's head and the phone, depending
  on the phone it may be measured in centimeters (i.e., the absolute distance) or
  as labels (e.g., 'near', 'far'). The dataset was collected as part of the WeNet
  project, a Horizon 2020 funded project that aims at developing a diversity-aware,
  machine-mediated paradigm for social interactions. It collected information on the
  eating/drinking activities of the students of the FPT University.
